CMPUT 410 W15 -- Lab Excercise 2
================================

- Write a Python program to manage a server socket.
- The server should reply to each typed message in the client by adding your name to it, like:
    Hello
    Hello Ali
- It should be able to respond to different clients simultaneously.
- Test your server with at least three clients (using telnet).
